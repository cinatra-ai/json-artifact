// The props snapshot a dynamically-loaded artifact renderer receives.
//
// This mirrors the host-supplied, versioned, fully-SERIALIZABLE snapshot a
// renderer is handed. A renderer requests NO host ports: it renders ONLY from
// this authorized snapshot — plain JSON data (row metadata, the resolved
// representation, host-authorized URLs, navigational action hrefs, and the
// content the server already read from the pinned revision). No closures, host
// context, or callable ports cross this boundary.
//
// THE VERSION IS 2 SINCE THE DISPLAY MOVED ONTO THE CONTENT CHANNEL. A v1
// snapshot carries no content field at all, which is why every display that
// declared v1 had to reach for its own bytes from the browser — and why none of
// them drew anything inside a third-party application, where that reach carries
// no credential. The host still BUILDS v1 for a display that declares v1, so the
// move is negotiated per display and is not a flag day; this display declares 2
// and floors, named, on anything older.
//
// The type is declared locally (not imported) so this extension stays a
// self-contained source mirror with no first-party host dependency: the renderer
// binds structurally to whatever snapshot the host serializes at mount.
